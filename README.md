# Zendesk Search

## Instructions

Using the provided data (tickets.json and users.json and organization.json ) write a simple command line application to search the data and return the results in a human readable format.

1. Where the data exists, values from any related entities should be included in the results. 

2. The user should be able to search on any field, full value matching is fine (e.g. “mar” won’t return “mary”). 

3. The user should also be able to search for empty values, e.g. where description is empty.
